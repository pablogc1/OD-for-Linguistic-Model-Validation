The codes here presented were created by the Author with the help of an AI code assistant (Gemini 2.5 Pro) to debug and document. In "All vs all Pairs" the whole pipeline with the OD calculations is found. In the two "All Corpora..." scripts one finds the analysis code for the results of the pipeline. In the "AI Corpus Generator" one can check the prompt fed to GPT-4o. The rest of the txt files are the corpora used in the work.
